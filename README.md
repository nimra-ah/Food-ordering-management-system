This C++ program is a Food Ordering System with the following features:

1:Menu Display: It displays four sectionsâ€”Appetizers, Mains, Desserts, and Beverages.
2:Order Placement: Users can select items from different sections to create their order.
3:Bill Generation: After ordering, a bill summary is displayed with the total amount, and the order is written to a file.
4:Order Management: Tracks order numbers using a file, ensuring unique order IDs.
It allows users to choose the service type (On-Dining, Take-Away, or Delivery) and adds the ordered items to a bill, which is saved in a text file for later reference.
